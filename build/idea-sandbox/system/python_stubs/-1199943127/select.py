    """
    select(rlist, wlist, xlist[, timeout]) -> (rlist, wlist, xlist)
    
    Wait until one or more file descriptors are ready for some kind of I/O.
    The first three arguments are sequences of file descriptors to be waited for:
    rlist -- wait until ready for reading
    wlist -- wait until ready for writing
    xlist -- wait for an ``exceptional condition''
    If only one kind of condition is required, pass [] for the other lists.
    A file descriptor is either a socket or file object, or a small integer
    gotten from a fileno() method call on one of those.
    
    The optional 4th argument specifies a timeout in seconds; it may be
    a floating point number to specify fractions of seconds.  If it is absent
    or None, the call will never time out.
    
    The return value is a tuple of three lists corresponding to the first three
    arguments; each contains the subset of the corresponding file descriptors
    that are ready.
    
    *** IMPORTANT NOTICE ***
    On Windows, only sockets are supported; on Unix, all file
    descriptors can be used.

    keep a proper reference count of the object once it's passed into the
    kernel. Therefore, I have restricted it to only storing an integer.  I
    recommend ignoring it and simply using the 'ident' field to key off
