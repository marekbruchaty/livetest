    beta(a, b, size=None)
    
            Draw samples from a Beta distribution.
    
            The Beta distribution is a special case of the Dirichlet distribution,
            and is related to the Gamma distribution.  It has the probability
            distribution function
    
            .. math:: f(x; a,b) = \frac{1}{B(\alpha, \beta)} x^{\alpha - 1}
                                                             (1 - x)^{\beta - 1},
    
            where the normalisation, B, is the beta function,
    
            .. math:: B(\alpha, \beta) = \int_0^1 t^{\alpha - 1}
                                         (1 - t)^{\beta - 1} dt.
    
            It is often seen in Bayesian inference and order statistics.
    
            Parameters
            ----------
            a : float or array_like of floats
                Alpha, non-negative.
            b : float or array_like of floats
                Beta, non-negative.
            size : int or tuple of ints, optional
                Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
                ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
                a single value is returned if ``a`` and ``b`` are both scalars.
                Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(a, b).size`` samples are drawn.
    
            Returns
            -------
            out : ndarray or scalar
                Drawn samples from the parameterized beta distribution.

    binomial(n, p, size=None)

            Samples are drawn from a binomial distribution with specified
            parameters, n trials and p probability of success where
            n an integer >= 0 and p is in the interval [0,1]. (n may be
            input as a float, but it is truncated to an integer in use)
    
            Parameters
            ----------
            n : int or array_like of ints
                Parameter of the distribution, >= 0. Floats are also accepted,
                but they will be truncated to integers.

                Parameter of the distribution, >= 0 and <=1.
            size : int or tuple of ints, optional
                Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then

            Returns
            -------
            out : ndarray or scalar
                Drawn samples from the parameterized binomial distribution, where
                each sample is equal to the number of successes over the n trials.

                cumulative density function, etc.
    
            Notes
            -----
            The probability density for the binomial distribution is
    
            .. math:: P(N) = \binom{n}{N}p^N(1-p)^{n-N},
    
            where :math:`n` is the number of trials, :math:`p` is the probability
            of success, and :math:`N` is the number of successes.
    
            When estimating the standard error of a proportion in a population by
            using a random sample, the normal distribution works well unless the
            product p*n <=5, where p = population proportion estimate, and n =
            number of samples, in which case the binomial distribution is used
            instead. For example, a sample of 15 people shows 4 who are left
            handed, and 11 who are right handed. Then p = 4/15 = 27%. 0.27*15 = 4,
            so the binomial distribution should be used in this case.

            `dfnum` (degrees of freedom in numerator) and `dfden` (degrees of
            freedom in denominator), where both parameters should be greater than
            zero.
    
            The random variate of the F distribution (also known as the
            Fisher distribution) is a continuous probability distribution
            that arises in ANOVA tests, and is the ratio of two chi-square
            variates.
    
            Parameters
            ----------
            dfnum : int or array_like of ints
                Degrees of freedom in numerator. Should be greater than zero.
            dfden : int or array_like of ints
                Degrees of freedom in denominator. Should be greater than zero.
            size : int or tuple of ints, optional
                Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
                ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
                a single value is returned if ``dfnum`` and ``dfden`` are both scalars.
                Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(dfnum, dfden).size`` samples are drawn.
    
            Returns
            -------
            out : ndarray or scalar
                Drawn samples from the parameterized Fisher distribution.

            Notes
            -----
            The F statistic is used to compare in-group variances to between-group
            variances. Calculating the distribution depends on the sampling, and
            so it is a function of the respective degrees of freedom in the
            problem.  The variable `dfnum` is the number of samples minus one, the
            between-groups degrees of freedom, while `dfden` is the within-groups
            degrees of freedom, the sum of the number of samples in each group
            minus the number of groups.

            An example from Glantz[1], pp 47-40:
    
            Two groups, children of diabetics (25 people) and children from people
            without diabetes (25 controls). Fasting blood glucose was measured,
            case group had a mean value of 86.1, controls had a mean value of
            82.2. Standard deviations were 2.09 and 2.49 respectively. Are these
            data consistent with the null hypothesis that the parents diabetic
            status does not affect their children's blood glucose levels?
            Calculating the F statistic from the data gives a value of 36.01.
    
            Draw samples from the distribution:
    
            >>> dfnum = 1. # between group degrees of freedom
            >>> dfden = 48. # within groups degrees of freedom
            >>> s = np.random.f(dfnum, dfden, 1000)
    
            The lower bound for the top 1% of the samples is :
    
            >>> sort(s)[-10]
            7.61988120985
    
            So there is about a 1% chance that the F statistic will exceed 7.62,
            the measured value is 36, so the null hypothesis is rejected at the 1%
            level.

            The Gumbel (or Smallest Extreme Value (SEV) or the Smallest Extreme
            Value Type I) distribution is one of a class of Generalized Extreme
            Value (GEV) distributions used in modeling extreme value problems.
            The Gumbel is a special case of the Extreme Value Type I distribution
            for maximums from distributions with "exponential-like" tails.
    
            The probability density for the Gumbel distribution is
    
            .. math:: p(x) = \frac{e^{-(x - \mu)/ \beta}}{\beta} e^{ -e^{-(x - \mu)/
                      \beta}},
    
            where :math:`\mu` is the mode, a location parameter, and
            :math:`\beta` is the scale parameter.
    
            The Gumbel (named for German mathematician Emil Julius Gumbel) was used
            very early in the hydrology literature, for modeling the occurrence of
            flood events. It is also used for modeling maximum wind speed and
            rainfall rates.  It is a "fat-tailed" distribution - the probability of
            an event in the tail of the distribution is larger than if one used a
            Gaussian, hence the surprisingly frequent occurrence of 100-year
            floods. Floods were initially modeled as a Gaussian process, which
            underestimated the frequency of extreme events.
    
            It is one of a class of extreme value distributions, the Generalized
            Extreme Value (GEV) distributions, which also includes the Weibull and
            Frechet.
    
            The function has a mean of :math:`\mu + 0.57721\beta` and a variance
            of :math:`\frac{\pi^2}{6}\beta^2`.

            The probability density for the Hypergeometric distribution is
    
            .. math:: P(x) = \frac{\binom{m}{n}\binom{N-m}{n-x}}{\binom{N}{n}},
    
            where :math:`0 \le x \le m` and :math:`n+m-N \le x \le n`
    
            for P(x) the probability of x successes, n = ngood, m = nbad, and
            N = number of samples.
    
            Consider an urn with black and white marbles in it, ngood of them
            black and nbad are white. If you draw nsample balls without
            replacement, then the hypergeometric distribution describes the
            distribution of black balls in the drawn sample.
    
            Note that this distribution is very similar to the binomial
            distribution, except that in this case, samples are drawn without
            replacement, whereas in the Binomial case samples are drawn with
            replacement (or the sample space is infinite). As the sample space
            becomes large, this distribution approaches the binomial.

    laplace(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=None)
    
            Draw samples from the Laplace or double exponential distribution with
            specified location (or mean) and scale (decay).
    
            The Laplace distribution is similar to the Gaussian/normal distribution,
            but is sharper at the peak and has fatter tails. It represents the
            difference between two independent, identically distributed exponential
            random variables.
    
            Parameters
            ----------
            loc : float or array_like of floats, optional
                The position, :math:`\mu`, of the distribution peak. Default is 0.
            scale : float or array_like of floats, optional
                :math:`\lambda`, the exponential decay. Default is 1.
            size : int or tuple of ints, optional
                Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
                ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
                a single value is returned if ``loc`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.
                Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(loc, scale).size`` samples are drawn.
    
            Returns
            -------
            out : ndarray or scalar
                Drawn samples from the parameterized Laplace distribution.
    
            Notes
            -----
            It has the probability density function
    
            .. math:: f(x; \mu, \lambda) = \frac{1}{2\lambda}
                                           \exp\left(-\frac{|x - \mu|}{\lambda}\right).
    
            The first law of Laplace, from 1774, states that the frequency
            of an error can be expressed as an exponential function of the
            absolute magnitude of the error, which leads to the Laplace
            distribution. For many problems in economics and health
            sciences, this distribution seems to model the data better
            than the standard Gaussian distribution.

            Notes
            -----
            A variable `x` has a log-normal distribution if `log(x)` is normally
            distributed.  The probability density function for the log-normal
            distribution is:
    
            .. math:: p(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma x \sqrt{2\pi}}
                             e^{(-\frac{(ln(x)-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2})}
    
            where :math:`\mu` is the mean and :math:`\sigma` is the standard
            deviation of the normally distributed logarithm of the variable.
            A log-normal distribution results if a random variable is the *product*
            of a large number of independent, identically-distributed variables in
            the same way that a normal distribution results if the variable is the
            *sum* of a large number of independent, identically-distributed
            variables.

                In other words, each entry ``out[i,j,...,:]`` is an N-dimensional
                value drawn from the distribution.
    
            Examples
            --------
            Throw a dice 20 times:
    
            >>> np.random.multinomial(20, [1/6.]*6, size=1)
            array([[4, 1, 7, 5, 2, 1]])
    
            It landed 4 times on 1, once on 2, etc.
    
            Now, throw the dice 20 times, and 20 times again:
    
            >>> np.random.multinomial(20, [1/6.]*6, size=2)
            array([[3, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3],
                   [2, 4, 3, 4, 0, 7]])
    
            For the first run, we threw 3 times 1, 4 times 2, etc.  For the second,
            we threw 2 times 1, 4 times 2, etc.
    
            A loaded die is more likely to land on number 6:
    
            >>> np.random.multinomial(100, [1/7.]*5 + [2/7.])
            array([11, 16, 14, 17, 16, 26])
    
            The probability inputs should be normalized. As an implementation
            detail, the value of the last entry is ignored and assumed to take
            up any leftover probability mass, but this should not be relied on.
            A biased coin which has twice as much weight on one side as on the
            other should be sampled like so:
    
            >>> np.random.multinomial(100, [1.0 / 3, 2.0 / 3])  # RIGHT
            array([38, 62])
    
            not like:
    
            >>> np.random.multinomial(100, [1.0, 2.0])  # WRONG
            array([100,   0])

def multivariate_normal(mean, cov, size=None, check_valid=None, tol=None): # real signature unknown; restored from __doc__
    """
    multivariate_normal(mean, cov[, size, check_valid, tol])
    
            Draw random samples from a multivariate normal distribution.
    
            The multivariate normal, multinormal or Gaussian distribution is a
            generalization of the one-dimensional normal distribution to higher
            dimensions.  Such a distribution is specified by its mean and
            covariance matrix.  These parameters are analogous to the mean
            (average or "center") and variance (standard deviation, or "width,"
            squared) of the one-dimensional normal distribution.
    
            Parameters
            ----------
            mean : 1-D array_like, of length N
                Mean of the N-dimensional distribution.
            cov : 2-D array_like, of shape (N, N)
                Covariance matrix of the distribution. It must be symmetric and
                positive-semidefinite for proper sampling.
            size : int or tuple of ints, optional
                Given a shape of, for example, ``(m,n,k)``, ``m*n*k`` samples are
                generated, and packed in an `m`-by-`n`-by-`k` arrangement.  Because
                each sample is `N`-dimensional, the output shape is ``(m,n,k,N)``.
                If no shape is specified, a single (`N`-D) sample is returned.
            check_valid : { 'warn', 'raise', 'ignore' }, optional
                Behavior when the covariance matrix is not positive semidefinite.
            tol : float, optional
                Tolerance when checking the singular values in covariance matrix.
    
            Returns
            -------
            out : ndarray
                The drawn samples, of shape *size*, if that was provided.  If not,
                the shape is ``(N,)``.
    
                In other words, each entry ``out[i,j,...,:]`` is an N-dimensional
                value drawn from the distribution.
    
            Notes
            -----
            The mean is a coordinate in N-dimensional space, which represents the
            location where samples are most likely to be generated.  This is
            analogous to the peak of the bell curve for the one-dimensional or
            univariate normal distribution.
    
            Covariance indicates the level to which two variables vary together.
            From the multivariate normal distribution, we draw N-dimensional
            samples, :math:`X = [x_1, x_2, ... x_N]`.  The covariance matrix
            element :math:`C_{ij}` is the covariance of :math:`x_i` and :math:`x_j`.
            The element :math:`C_{ii}` is the variance of :math:`x_i` (i.e. its
            "spread").
    
            Instead of specifying the full covariance matrix, popular
            approximations include:
    
              - Spherical covariance (`cov` is a multiple of the identity matrix)
              - Diagonal covariance (`cov` has non-negative elements, and only on
                the diagonal)
    
            This geometrical property can be seen in two dimensions by plotting
            generated data-points:
    
            >>> mean = [0, 0]
            >>> cov = [[1, 0], [0, 100]]  # diagonal covariance
    
            Diagonal covariance means that points are oriented along x or y-axis:
    
            >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
            >>> x, y = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean, cov, 5000).T
            >>> plt.plot(x, y, 'x')
            >>> plt.axis('equal')
            >>> plt.show()
    
            Note that the covariance matrix must be positive semidefinite (a.k.a.
            nonnegative-definite). Otherwise, the behavior of this method is
            undefined and backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.

            independently [2]_, is often called the bell curve because of
            its characteristic shape (see the example below).
    
            The normal distributions occurs often in nature.  For example, it
            describes the commonly occurring distribution of samples influenced
            by a large number of tiny, random disturbances, each with its own
            unique distribution [2]_.
    
            Parameters
            ----------
            loc : float or array_like of floats
                Mean ("centre") of the distribution.
            scale : float or array_like of floats
                Standard deviation (spread or "width") of the distribution.
            size : int or tuple of ints, optional
                Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
                ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
                a single value is returned if ``loc`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.
                Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(loc, scale).size`` samples are drawn.
    
            Returns
            -------
            out : ndarray or scalar
                Drawn samples from the parameterized normal distribution.

            Notes
            -----
            The probability density for the Gaussian distribution is
    
            .. math:: p(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 \pi \sigma^2 }}
                             e^{ - \frac{ (x - \mu)^2 } {2 \sigma^2} },
    
            where :math:`\mu` is the mean and :math:`\sigma` the standard
            deviation. The square of the standard deviation, :math:`\sigma^2`,
            is called the variance.
    
            The function has its peak at the mean, and its "spread" increases with
            the standard deviation (the function reaches 0.607 times its maximum at
            :math:`x + \sigma` and :math:`x - \sigma` [2]_).  This implies that
            `numpy.random.normal` is more likely to return samples lying close to
            the mean, rather than those far away.

    pareto(a, size=None)
    
            Draw samples from a Pareto II or Lomax distribution with
            specified shape.
    
            The Lomax or Pareto II distribution is a shifted Pareto
            distribution. The classical Pareto distribution can be
            obtained from the Lomax distribution by adding 1 and
            multiplying by the scale parameter ``m`` (see Notes).  The
            smallest value of the Lomax distribution is zero while for the
            classical Pareto distribution it is ``mu``, where the standard
            Pareto distribution has location ``mu = 1``.  Lomax can also
            be considered as a simplified version of the Generalized
            Pareto distribution (available in SciPy), with the scale set
            to one and the location set to zero.
    
            The Pareto distribution must be greater than zero, and is
            unbounded above.  It is also known as the "80-20 rule".  In
            this distribution, 80 percent of the weights are in the lowest
            20 percent of the range, while the other 20 percent fill the
            remaining 80 percent of the range.
    
            Parameters
            ----------
            a : float or array_like of floats
                Shape of the distribution. Should be greater than zero.
            size : int or tuple of ints, optional
                Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
                ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
                a single value is returned if ``a`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
                ``np.array(a).size`` samples are drawn.
    
            Returns
            -------
            out : ndarray or scalar

            Notes
            -----
            The probability density for the Pareto distribution is
    
            .. math:: p(x) = \frac{am^a}{x^{a+1}}
    
            where :math:`a` is the shape and :math:`m` the scale.
    
            The Pareto distribution, named after the Italian economist
            Vilfredo Pareto, is a power law probability distribution
            useful in many real world problems.  Outside the field of
            economics it is generally referred to as the Bradford
            distribution. Pareto developed the distribution to describe
            the distribution of wealth in an economy.  It has also found
            use in insurance, web page access statistics, oil field sizes,
            and many other problems, including the download frequency for
            projects in Sourceforge [1]_.  It is one of the so-called
            "fat-tailed" distributions.

            Return random integers from the "discrete uniform" distribution of
            the specified dtype in the "half-open" interval [`low`, `high`). If
            `high` is None (the default), then results are from [0, `low`).
    
            Parameters
            ----------
            low : int
                Lowest (signed) integer to be drawn from the distribution (unless
                ``high=None``, in which case this parameter is one above the
                *highest* such integer).
            high : int, optional
                If provided, one above the largest (signed) integer to be drawn
                from the distribution (see above for behavior if ``high=None``).
            size : int or tuple of ints, optional
                Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
                ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
                single value is returned.
            dtype : dtype, optional
                Desired dtype of the result. All dtypes are determined by their
                name, i.e., 'int64', 'int', etc, so byteorder is not available
                and a specific precision may have different C types depending
                on the platform. The default value is 'np.int'.

    randn(d0, d1, ..., dn)
    
            Return a sample (or samples) from the "standard normal" distribution.
    
            If positive, int_like or int-convertible arguments are provided,
            `randn` generates an array of shape ``(d0, d1, ..., dn)``, filled
            with random floats sampled from a univariate "normal" (Gaussian)
            distribution of mean 0 and variance 1 (if any of the :math:`d_i` are
            floats, they are first converted to integers by truncation). A single

            The Rayleigh distribution would arise, for example, if the East

            Gaussian distributions.  Then the wind speed would have a Rayleigh

            The probability density function for the full Cauchy distribution is
    
            .. math:: P(x; x_0, \gamma) = \frac{1}{\pi \gamma \bigl[ 1+
                      (\frac{x-x_0}{\gamma})^2 \bigr] }
    
            and the Standard Cauchy distribution just sets :math:`x_0=0` and
            :math:`\gamma=1`
    
            The Cauchy distribution arises in the solution to the driven harmonic
            oscillator problem, and also describes spectral line broadening. It
            also describes the distribution of values at which a line tilted at
            a random angle will cut the x axis.
    
            When studying hypothesis tests that assume normality, seeing how the
            tests perform on data from a Cauchy distribution is a good indicator of
            their sensitivity to a heavy-tailed distribution, since the Cauchy looks
            very much like a Gaussian distribution, but with heavier tails.

            -----
            The probability density for the Gamma distribution is
    
            .. math:: p(x) = x^{k-1}\frac{e^{-x/\theta}}{\theta^k\Gamma(k)},
    
            where :math:`k` is the shape and :math:`\theta` the scale,
            and :math:`\Gamma` is the Gamma function.
    
            The Gamma distribution is often used to model the times to failure of
            electronic components, and arises naturally in processes for which the
            waiting times between Poisson distributed events are relevant.

            The t test is based on an assumption that the data come from a
            Normal distribution. The t test provides a way to test whether
            the sample mean (that is the mean calculated from the data) is
            a good estimate of the true mean.
    
            The derivation of the t-distribution was first published in
            1908 by William Gosset while working for the Guinness Brewery
            in Dublin. Due to proprietary issues, he had to publish under
            a pseudonym, and so he used the name Student.

            From Dalgaard page 83 [1]_, suppose the daily energy intake for 11
            women in Kj is:
    
            >>> intake = np.array([5260., 5470, 5640, 6180, 6390, 6515, 6805, 7515, \

            Does their energy intake deviate systematically from the recommended
            value of 7725 kJ?
    
            We have 10 degrees of freedom, so is the sample mean within 95% of the
            recommended value?
    
            >>> s = np.random.standard_t(10, size=100000)
            >>> np.mean(intake)
            6753.636363636364
            >>> intake.std(ddof=1)
            1142.1232221373727
    
            Calculate the t statistic, setting the ddof parameter to the unbiased
            value so the divisor in the standard deviation will be degrees of
            freedom, N-1.

            For a one-sided t-test, how far out in the distribution does the t
            statistic appear?

            circle.  It may be thought of as the circular analogue of the normal
            distribution.
    
            Parameters
            ----------
            mu : float or array_like of floats
                Mode ("center") of the distribution.
            kappa : float or array_like of floats
                Dispersion of the distribution, has to be >=0.
            size : int or tuple of ints, optional
                Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
                ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
                a single value is returned if ``mu`` and ``kappa`` are both scalars.
                Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(mu, kappa).size`` samples are drawn.
    
            Returns
            -------
            out : ndarray or scalar
                Drawn samples from the parameterized von Mises distribution.

            Notes
            -----
            The probability density for the von Mises distribution is
    
            .. math:: p(x) = \frac{e^{\kappa cos(x-\mu)}}{2\pi I_0(\kappa)},
    
            where :math:`\mu` is the mode and :math:`\kappa` the dispersion,
            and :math:`I_0(\kappa)` is the modified Bessel function of order 0.
    
            The von Mises is named for Richard Edler von Mises, who was born in
            Austria-Hungary, in what is now the Ukraine.  He fled to the United
            States in 1939 and became a professor at Harvard.  He worked in
            probability theory, aerodynamics, fluid mechanics, and philosophy of
            science.

def wald(mean, scale, size=None): # real signature unknown; restored from __doc__
    """
    wald(mean, scale, size=None)
    
            Draw samples from a Wald, or inverse Gaussian, distribution.
    
            As the scale approaches infinity, the distribution becomes more like a
            Gaussian. Some references claim that the Wald is an inverse Gaussian
            with mean equal to 1, but this is by no means universal.
    
            The inverse Gaussian distribution was first studied in relationship to
            Brownian motion. In 1956 M.C.K. Tweedie used the name inverse Gaussian
            because there is an inverse relationship between the time to cover a
            unit distance and distance covered in unit time.
    
            Parameters
            ----------
            mean : float or array_like of floats
                Distribution mean, should be > 0.
            scale : float or array_like of floats
                Scale parameter, should be >= 0.
            size : int or tuple of ints, optional
                Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
                ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
                a single value is returned if ``mean`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.
                Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(mean, scale).size`` samples are drawn.
    
            Returns
            -------
            out : ndarray or scalar
                Drawn samples from the parameterized Wald distribution.
    
            Notes
            -----
            The probability density function for the Wald distribution is
    
            .. math:: P(x;mean,scale) = \sqrt{\frac{scale}{2\pi x^3}}e^
                                        \frac{-scale(x-mean)^2}{2\cdotp mean^2x}
    
            As noted above the inverse Gaussian distribution first arise
            from attempts to model Brownian motion. It is also a
            competitor to the Weibull for use in reliability modeling and
            modeling stock returns and interest rate processes.

            The Weibull (or Type III asymptotic extreme value distribution
            for smallest values, SEV Type III, or Rosin-Rammler
            distribution) is one of a class of Generalized Extreme Value
            (GEV) distributions used in modeling extreme value problems.
            This class includes the Gumbel and Frechet distributions.
    
            The probability density for the Weibull distribution is
    
            .. math:: p(x) = \frac{a}
                             {\lambda}(\frac{x}{\lambda})^{a-1}e^{-(x/\lambda)^a},
    
            where :math:`a` is the shape and :math:`\lambda` the scale.
    
            The function has its peak (the mode) at
            :math:`\lambda(\frac{a-1}{a})^{1/a}`.
    
            When ``a = 1``, the Weibull distribution reduces to the exponential
            distribution.

    RandomState(seed=None)
    
        Container for the Mersenne Twister pseudo-random number generator.
    
        `RandomState` exposes a number of methods for generating random numbers
        drawn from a variety of probability distributions. In addition to the
        distribution-specific arguments, each method takes a keyword argument
        `size` that defaults to ``None``. If `size` is ``None``, then a single
        value is generated and returned. If `size` is an integer, then a 1-D
        array filled with generated values is returned. If `size` is a tuple,
        then an array with that shape is filled and returned.
    
        *Compatibility Guarantee*
        A fixed seed and a fixed series of calls to 'RandomState' methods using
        the same parameters will always produce the same results up to roundoff
        error except when the values were incorrect. Incorrect values will be
        fixed and the NumPy version in which the fix was made will be noted in
        the relevant docstring. Extension of existing parameter ranges and the
        addition of new parameters is allowed as long the previous behavior
        remains unchanged.
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        seed : {None, int, array_like}, optional
            Random seed used to initialize the pseudo-random number generator.  Can
            be any integer between 0 and 2**32 - 1 inclusive, an array (or other
            sequence) of such integers, or ``None`` (the default).  If `seed` is
            ``None``, then `RandomState` will try to read data from
            ``/dev/urandom`` (or the Windows analogue) if available or seed from
            the clock otherwise.
    
        Notes
        -----
        The Python stdlib module "random" also contains a Mersenne Twister
        pseudo-random number generator with a number of methods that are similar
        to the ones available in `RandomState`. `RandomState`, besides being
        NumPy-aware, has the advantage that it provides a much larger number
        of probability distributions to choose from.

                Notes
                -----
                The probability density for the binomial distribution is
        
                .. math:: P(N) = \binom{n}{N}p^N(1-p)^{n-N},
        
                where :math:`n` is the number of trials, :math:`p` is the probability
                of success, and :math:`N` is the number of successes.
        
                When estimating the standard error of a proportion in a population by
                using a random sample, the normal distribution works well unless the
                product p*n <=5, where p = population proportion estimate, and n =
                number of samples, in which case the binomial distribution is used
                instead. For example, a sample of 15 people shows 4 who are left
                handed, and 11 who are right handed. Then p = 4/15 = 27%. 0.27*15 = 4,
                so the binomial distribution should be used in this case.

                The F statistic is used to compare in-group variances to between-group
                variances. Calculating the distribution depends on the sampling, and
                so it is a function of the respective degrees of freedom in the
                problem.  The variable `dfnum` is the number of samples minus one, the
                between-groups degrees of freedom, while `dfden` is the within-groups
                degrees of freedom, the sum of the number of samples in each group
                minus the number of groups.

                Two groups, children of diabetics (25 people) and children from people
                without diabetes (25 controls). Fasting blood glucose was measured,
                case group had a mean value of 86.1, controls had a mean value of
                82.2. Standard deviations were 2.09 and 2.49 respectively. Are these
                data consistent with the null hypothesis that the parents diabetic
                status does not affect their children's blood glucose levels?
                Calculating the F statistic from the data gives a value of 36.01.
        
                Draw samples from the distribution:
        
                >>> dfnum = 1. # between group degrees of freedom
                >>> dfden = 48. # within groups degrees of freedom

                7.61988120985
        
                So there is about a 1% chance that the F statistic will exceed 7.62,
                the measured value is 36, so the null hypothesis is rejected at the 1%
                level.

                Bernoulli trials are experiments with one of two outcomes:
                success or failure (an example of such an experiment is flipping
                a coin).  The geometric distribution models the number of trials
                that must be run in order to achieve success.  It is therefore
                supported on the positive integers, ``k = 1, 2, ...``.
        
                The probability mass function of the geometric distribution is
        
                .. math:: f(k) = (1 - p)^{k - 1} p
        
                where `p` is the probability of success of an individual trial.

                The Gumbel (or Smallest Extreme Value (SEV) or the Smallest Extreme
                Value Type I) distribution is one of a class of Generalized Extreme
                Value (GEV) distributions used in modeling extreme value problems.
                The Gumbel is a special case of the Extreme Value Type I distribution
                for maximums from distributions with "exponential-like" tails.
        
                The probability density for the Gumbel distribution is
        
                .. math:: p(x) = \frac{e^{-(x - \mu)/ \beta}}{\beta} e^{ -e^{-(x - \mu)/
                          \beta}},
        
                where :math:`\mu` is the mode, a location parameter, and
                :math:`\beta` is the scale parameter.
        
                The Gumbel (named for German mathematician Emil Julius Gumbel) was used
                very early in the hydrology literature, for modeling the occurrence of
                flood events. It is also used for modeling maximum wind speed and
                rainfall rates.  It is a "fat-tailed" distribution - the probability of
                an event in the tail of the distribution is larger than if one used a
                Gaussian, hence the surprisingly frequent occurrence of 100-year
                floods. Floods were initially modeled as a Gaussian process, which
                underestimated the frequency of extreme events.
        
                It is one of a class of extreme value distributions, the Generalized
                Extreme Value (GEV) distributions, which also includes the Weibull and
                Frechet.
        
                The function has a mean of :math:`\mu + 0.57721\beta` and a variance
                of :math:`\frac{\pi^2}{6}\beta^2`.

                Notes

                The probability density for the Hypergeometric distribution is

                for P(x) the probability of x successes, n = ngood, m = nbad, and
                N = number of samples.
        
                Consider an urn with black and white marbles in it, ngood of them
                black and nbad are white. If you draw nsample balls without
                replacement, then the hypergeometric distribution describes the
                distribution of black balls in the drawn sample.
        
                Note that this distribution is very similar to the binomial
                distribution, except that in this case, samples are drawn without
                replacement, whereas in the Binomial case samples are drawn with
                replacement (or the sample space is infinite). As the sample space
                becomes large, this distribution approaches the binomial.

                The first law of Laplace, from 1774, states that the frequency
                of an error can be expressed as an exponential function of the
                absolute magnitude of the error, which leads to the Laplace
                distribution. For many problems in economics and health
                sciences, this distribution seems to model the data better
                than the standard Gaussian distribution.

                A variable `x` has a log-normal distribution if `log(x)` is normally
                distributed.  The probability density function for the log-normal
                distribution is:
        
                .. math:: p(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma x \sqrt{2\pi}}
                                 e^{(-\frac{(ln(x)-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2})}
        
                where :math:`\mu` is the mean and :math:`\sigma` is the standard
                deviation of the normally distributed logarithm of the variable.
                A log-normal distribution results if a random variable is the *product*
                of a large number of independent, identically-distributed variables in
                the same way that a normal distribution results if the variable is the
                *sum* of a large number of independent, identically-distributed
                variables.

                The multinomial distribution is a multivariate generalisation of the
                binomial distribution.  Take an experiment with one of ``p``

                    Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
                    ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
                    single value is returned.
        
                Returns
                -------
                out : ndarray
                    The drawn samples, of shape *size*, if that was provided.  If not,
                    the shape is ``(N,)``.
        
                    In other words, each entry ``out[i,j,...,:]`` is an N-dimensional
                    value drawn from the distribution.
        
                Examples

                Throw a dice 20 times:
        
                >>> np.random.multinomial(20, [1/6.]*6, size=1)
                array([[4, 1, 7, 5, 2, 1]])
        
                It landed 4 times on 1, once on 2, etc.
        
                Now, throw the dice 20 times, and 20 times again:
        
                >>> np.random.multinomial(20, [1/6.]*6, size=2)
                array([[3, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3],
                       [2, 4, 3, 4, 0, 7]])
        
                For the first run, we threw 3 times 1, 4 times 2, etc.  For the second,
                we threw 2 times 1, 4 times 2, etc.
        
                A loaded die is more likely to land on number 6:
        
                >>> np.random.multinomial(100, [1/7.]*5 + [2/7.])
                array([11, 16, 14, 17, 16, 26])
        
                The probability inputs should be normalized. As an implementation
                detail, the value of the last entry is ignored and assumed to take
                up any leftover probability mass, but this should not be relied on.
                A biased coin which has twice as much weight on one side as on the
                other should be sampled like so:
        
                >>> np.random.multinomial(100, [1.0 / 3, 2.0 / 3])  # RIGHT
                array([38, 62])

                Draw random samples from a multivariate normal distribution.
        
                The multivariate normal, multinormal or Gaussian distribution is a
                generalization of the one-dimensional normal distribution to higher
                dimensions.  Such a distribution is specified by its mean and
                covariance matrix.  These parameters are analogous to the mean
                (average or "center") and variance (standard deviation, or "width,"
                squared) of the one-dimensional normal distribution.
        
                Parameters
                ----------
                mean : 1-D array_like, of length N
                    Mean of the N-dimensional distribution.
                cov : 2-D array_like, of shape (N, N)
                    Covariance matrix of the distribution. It must be symmetric and
                    positive-semidefinite for proper sampling.
                size : int or tuple of ints, optional
                    Given a shape of, for example, ``(m,n,k)``, ``m*n*k`` samples are
                    generated, and packed in an `m`-by-`n`-by-`k` arrangement.  Because
                    each sample is `N`-dimensional, the output shape is ``(m,n,k,N)``.
                    If no shape is specified, a single (`N`-D) sample is returned.
                check_valid : { 'warn', 'raise', 'ignore' }, optional
                    Behavior when the covariance matrix is not positive semidefinite.
                tol : float, optional
                    Tolerance when checking the singular values in covariance matrix.
        
                Returns
                -------
                out : ndarray
                    The drawn samples, of shape *size*, if that was provided.  If not,
                    the shape is ``(N,)``.
        
                    In other words, each entry ``out[i,j,...,:]`` is an N-dimensional
                    value drawn from the distribution.
        
                Notes
                -----
                The mean is a coordinate in N-dimensional space, which represents the
                location where samples are most likely to be generated.  This is
                analogous to the peak of the bell curve for the one-dimensional or
                univariate normal distribution.
        
                Covariance indicates the level to which two variables vary together.
                From the multivariate normal distribution, we draw N-dimensional
                samples, :math:`X = [x_1, x_2, ... x_N]`.  The covariance matrix
                element :math:`C_{ij}` is the covariance of :math:`x_i` and :math:`x_j`.
                The element :math:`C_{ii}` is the variance of :math:`x_i` (i.e. its
                "spread").
        
                Instead of specifying the full covariance matrix, popular
                approximations include:
        
                  - Spherical covariance (`cov` is a multiple of the identity matrix)
                  - Diagonal covariance (`cov` has non-negative elements, and only on
                    the diagonal)
        
                This geometrical property can be seen in two dimensions by plotting
                generated data-points:
        
                >>> mean = [0, 0]
                >>> cov = [[1, 0], [0, 100]]  # diagonal covariance
        
                Diagonal covariance means that points are oriented along x or y-axis:
        
                >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
                >>> x, y = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean, cov, 5000).T
                >>> plt.plot(x, y, 'x')
                >>> plt.axis('equal')
                >>> plt.show()
        
                Note that the covariance matrix must be positive semidefinite (a.k.a.
                nonnegative-definite). Otherwise, the behavior of this method is
                undefined and backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.

                Notes
                -----

                probability of success, and :math:`N+n-1` is the number of trials.
                The negative binomial distribution gives the probability of n-1
                successes and N failures in N+n-1 trials, and success on the (N+n)th
                trial.
        
                If one throws a die repeatedly until the third time a "1" appears,
                then the probability distribution of the number of non-"1"s that
                appear before the third "1" is a negative binomial distribution.

                -----
                When calculating the power of an experiment (power = probability of
                rejecting the null hypothesis when a specific alternative is true) the
                non-central F statistic becomes important.  When the null hypothesis is
                true, the F statistic follows a central F distribution. When the null
                hypothesis is not true, then it follows a non-central F statistic.

                In a study, testing for a specific alternative to the null hypothesis
                requires use of the Noncentral F distribution. We need to calculate the
                area in the tail of the distribution that exceeds the value of the F
                distribution for the null hypothesis.  We'll plot the two probability
                distributions for comparison.

                Draw random samples from a normal (Gaussian) distribution.
        
                The probability density function of the normal distribution, first
                derived by De Moivre and 200 years later by both Gauss and Laplace
                independently [2]_, is often called the bell curve because of
                its characteristic shape (see the example below).
        
                The normal distributions occurs often in nature.  For example, it
                describes the commonly occurring distribution of samples influenced
                by a large number of tiny, random disturbances, each with its own
                unique distribution [2]_.
        
                Parameters
                ----------
                loc : float or array_like of floats
                    Mean ("centre") of the distribution.
                scale : float or array_like of floats
                    Standard deviation (spread or "width") of the distribution.
                size : int or tuple of ints, optional
                    Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
                    ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
                    a single value is returned if ``loc`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.
                    Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(loc, scale).size`` samples are drawn.

                out : ndarray or scalar
                    Drawn samples from the parameterized normal distribution.

                Notes
                -----
                The probability density for the Gaussian distribution is
        
                .. math:: p(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 \pi \sigma^2 }}
                                 e^{ - \frac{ (x - \mu)^2 } {2 \sigma^2} },
        
                where :math:`\mu` is the mean and :math:`\sigma` the standard
                deviation. The square of the standard deviation, :math:`\sigma^2`,
                is called the variance.
        
                The function has its peak at the mean, and its "spread" increases with
                the standard deviation (the function reaches 0.607 times its maximum at
                :math:`x + \sigma` and :math:`x - \sigma` [2]_).  This implies that
                `numpy.random.normal` is more likely to return samples lying close to
                the mean, rather than those far away.

                Draw samples from a Pareto II or Lomax distribution with
                specified shape.
        
                The Lomax or Pareto II distribution is a shifted Pareto
                distribution. The classical Pareto distribution can be
                obtained from the Lomax distribution by adding 1 and
                multiplying by the scale parameter ``m`` (see Notes).  The
                smallest value of the Lomax distribution is zero while for the
                classical Pareto distribution it is ``mu``, where the standard
                Pareto distribution has location ``mu = 1``.  Lomax can also
                be considered as a simplified version of the Generalized
                Pareto distribution (available in SciPy), with the scale set
                to one and the location set to zero.
        
                The Pareto distribution must be greater than zero, and is
                unbounded above.  It is also known as the "80-20 rule".  In
                this distribution, 80 percent of the weights are in the lowest
                20 percent of the range, while the other 20 percent fill the
                remaining 80 percent of the range.

                ----------

                    a single value is returned if ``a`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
                    ``np.array(a).size`` samples are drawn.

                The probability density for the Pareto distribution is

                The Pareto distribution, named after the Italian economist
                Vilfredo Pareto, is a power law probability distribution
                useful in many real world problems.  Outside the field of
                economics it is generally referred to as the Bradford
                distribution. Pareto developed the distribution to describe
                the distribution of wealth in an economy.  It has also found
                use in insurance, web page access statistics, oil field sizes,
                and many other problems, including the download frequency for
                projects in Sourceforge [1]_.  It is one of the so-called
                "fat-tailed" distributions.

                a : float or array_like of floats

                -----
                The probability density function is
        
                .. math:: P(x; a) = ax^{a-1}, 0 \le x \le 1, a>0.
        
                The power function distribution is just the inverse of the Pareto
                distribution. It may also be seen as a special case of the Beta
                distribution.
        
                It is used, for example, in modeling the over-reporting of insurance
                claims.

                Returns
                -------
                out : float or ndarray of floats
                    Array of random floats of shape `size` (unless ``size=None``, in which
                    case a single float is returned).

        rayleigh(scale=1.0, size=None)
        
                Draw samples from a Rayleigh distribution.
        
                The :math:`\chi` and Weibull distributions are generalizations of the

                scale : float or array_like of floats, optional
                    Scale, also equals the mode. Should be >= 0. Default is 1.

                    ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
                    a single value is returned if ``scale`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
                    ``np.array(scale).size`` samples are drawn.

                Notes
                -----
                The probability density function for the Rayleigh distribution is
        
                .. math:: P(x;scale) = \frac{x}{scale^2}e^{\frac{-x^2}{2 \cdotp scale^2}}
        
                The Rayleigh distribution would arise, for example, if the East
                and North components of the wind velocity had identical zero-mean
                Gaussian distributions.  Then the wind speed would have a Rayleigh
                distribution.

                `set_state` and `get_state` are not needed to work with any of the

                and the Standard Cauchy distribution just sets :math:`x_0=0` and
                :math:`\gamma=1`
        
                The Cauchy distribution arises in the solution to the driven harmonic
                oscillator problem, and also describes spectral line broadening. It
                also describes the distribution of values at which a line tilted at
                a random angle will cut the x axis.
        
                When studying hypothesis tests that assume normality, seeing how the
                tests perform on data from a Cauchy distribution is a good indicator of
                their sensitivity to a heavy-tailed distribution, since the Cauchy looks
                very much like a Gaussian distribution, but with heavier tails.

                A special case of the hyperbolic distribution.  As `df` gets

                -------

                Notes
                -----
                The probability density function for the t distribution is
        
                .. math:: P(x, df) = \frac{\Gamma(\frac{df+1}{2})}{\sqrt{\pi df}
                          \Gamma(\frac{df}{2})}\Bigl( 1+\frac{x^2}{df} \Bigr)^{-(df+1)/2}
        
                The t test is based on an assumption that the data come from a
                Normal distribution. The t test provides a way to test whether
                the sample mean (that is the mean calculated from the data) is
                a good estimate of the true mean.
        
                The derivation of the t-distribution was first published in
                1908 by William Gosset while working for the Guinness Brewery
                in Dublin. Due to proprietary issues, he had to publish under
                a pseudonym, and so he used the name Student.

                Examples
                --------
                From Dalgaard page 83 [1]_, suppose the daily energy intake for 11
                women in Kj is:
        
                >>> intake = np.array([5260., 5470, 5640, 6180, 6390, 6515, 6805, 7515, \
                ...                    7515, 8230, 8770])
        
                Does their energy intake deviate systematically from the recommended
                value of 7725 kJ?
        
                We have 10 degrees of freedom, so is the sample mean within 95% of the
                recommended value?
        
                >>> s = np.random.standard_t(10, size=100000)
                >>> np.mean(intake)
                6753.636363636364
                >>> intake.std(ddof=1)
                1142.1232221373727
        
                Calculate the t statistic, setting the ddof parameter to the unbiased
                value so the divisor in the standard deviation will be degrees of
                freedom, N-1.
        
                >>> t = (np.mean(intake)-7725)/(intake.std(ddof=1)/np.sqrt(len(intake)))
                >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
                >>> h = plt.hist(s, bins=100, normed=True)
        
                For a one-sided t-test, how far out in the distribution does the t
                statistic appear?
        
                >>> np.sum(s<t) / float(len(s))
                0.0090699999999999999  #random
        
                So the p-value is about 0.009, which says the null hypothesis has a
                probability of about 99% of being true.

                The triangular distribution is a continuous probability
                distribution with lower limit left, peak at mode, and upper
                limit right. Unlike the other distributions, these parameters

                left : float or array_like of floats

                The triangular distribution is often used in ill-defined
                problems where the underlying distribution is not known, but
                some knowledge of the limits and mode exists. Often it is used

                The probability density for the von Mises distribution is
        
                .. math:: p(x) = \frac{e^{\kappa cos(x-\mu)}}{2\pi I_0(\kappa)},
        
                where :math:`\mu` is the mode and :math:`\kappa` the dispersion,
                and :math:`I_0(\kappa)` is the modified Bessel function of order 0.
        
                The von Mises is named for Richard Edler von Mises, who was born in
                Austria-Hungary, in what is now the Ukraine.  He fled to the United
                States in 1939 and became a professor at Harvard.  He worked in
                probability theory, aerodynamics, fluid mechanics, and philosophy of
                science.

        wald(mean, scale, size=None)
        
                Draw samples from a Wald, or inverse Gaussian, distribution.
        
                As the scale approaches infinity, the distribution becomes more like a
                Gaussian. Some references claim that the Wald is an inverse Gaussian
                with mean equal to 1, but this is by no means universal.
        
                The inverse Gaussian distribution was first studied in relationship to
                Brownian motion. In 1956 M.C.K. Tweedie used the name inverse Gaussian
                because there is an inverse relationship between the time to cover a
                unit distance and distance covered in unit time.
        
                Parameters
                ----------
                mean : float or array_like of floats
                    Distribution mean, should be > 0.
                scale : float or array_like of floats
                    Scale parameter, should be >= 0.
                size : int or tuple of ints, optional
                    Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
                    ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
                    a single value is returned if ``mean`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.
                    Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(mean, scale).size`` samples are drawn.
        
                Returns
                -------
                out : ndarray or scalar
                    Drawn samples from the parameterized Wald distribution.
        
                Notes
                -----
                The probability density function for the Wald distribution is
        
                .. math:: P(x;mean,scale) = \sqrt{\frac{scale}{2\pi x^3}}e^
                                            \frac{-scale(x-mean)^2}{2\cdotp mean^2x}
        
                As noted above the inverse Gaussian distribution first arise
                from attempts to model Brownian motion. It is also a
                competitor to the Weibull for use in reliability modeling and
                modeling stock returns and interest rate processes.

                The Weibull (or Type III asymptotic extreme value distribution
                for smallest values, SEV Type III, or Rosin-Rammler
                distribution) is one of a class of Generalized Extreme Value
                (GEV) distributions used in modeling extreme value problems.
                This class includes the Gumbel and Frechet distributions.
        
                The probability density for the Weibull distribution is
        
                .. math:: p(x) = \frac{a}

                where :math:`a` is the shape and :math:`\lambda` the scale.
        
                The function has its peak (the mode) at
                :math:`\lambda(\frac{a-1}{a})^{1/a}`.
        
                When ``a = 1``, the Weibull distribution reduces to the exponential
                distribution.

It is a "fat-tailed" distribution - the probability of\n        an event in the tail of the distribution is larger than if one used a\n        Gaussian, hence the surprisingly frequent occurrence of 100-year\n        floods. Floods were initially modeled as a Gaussian process, which\n        underestimated the frequency of extreme events.\n\n        It is one of a class of extreme value distributions, the Generalized\n        Extreme Value (GEV) distributions, which also includes the Weibull and\n        Frechet.\n\n        The function has a mean of :math:`\\mu + 0.57721\\beta` and a variance\n        of :math:`\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}\\beta^2`.\n\n        References\n        ----------\n        ..

Tweedie used the name inverse Gaussian\n        because there is an inverse relationship between the time to cover a\n        unit distance and distance covered in unit time.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        mean : float or array_like of floats\n            Distribution mean, should be > 0.\n        scale : float or array_like of floats\n            Scale parameter, should be >= 0.\n        size : int or tuple of ints, optional\n            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then\n            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),\n            a single value is returned if ``mean`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.\n            Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(mean, scale).size`` samples are drawn.\n\n        Returns\n        -------\n        out : ndarray or scalar\n            Drawn samples from the parameterized Wald distribution.\n\n        Notes\n        -----\n        The probability density function for the Wald distribution is\n\n        .. math:: P(x;mean,scale) = \\sqrt{\\frac{scale}{2\\pi x^3}}e^\n                                    \\frac{-scale(x-mean)^2}{2\\cdotp mean^2x}\n\n        As noted above the inverse Gaussian distribution first arise\n        from attempts to model Brownian motion. It is also a\n        competitor to the Weibull for use in reliability modeling and\n        modeling stock returns and interest rate processes.\n\n        References\n        ----------\n        ..
